PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank websites in their search engine results.

Explain how PageRank algorithm works and discuss its variants.

Mathematically, PageRank values are in the dominant eigenvector of the (modified) adjacency matrix. Based on that, in your IPython example, show how to solve a matrix formulation of PageRank algorithm for a web of 5-10 webpages/websites.

Prepare 10 minute presentation of your results. Before the presentation, upload your video recording in mp4 or avi format, PowerPoint slides, PDF slides, IPython Notebook ipynb file(s) and all data files in zip archive via Quercus portal, such that those can be posted on the course web-page and re-used by your colleagues for assignments and a course project
